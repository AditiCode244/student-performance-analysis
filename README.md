# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using data science and machine learning techniques.
The goal is to help teachers understand which features influence student success and build a predictive model for early intervention.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Educational institutions often struggle to identify students at risk of poor academic performance. By analyzing past student data, we can discover patterns and predict final outcomes, helping teachers take preventive action.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Dataset: Student Performance Dataset
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devansodariya/student-performance-data
- Number of Students: 395 
- Features Include:
  - Study Time
  - Absences
  - Previous Grades (G1, G2)
  - Family Background
  - Internet Access
  - Extra Activities

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python – programming language

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Key Insights:
  
- Study time is positively correlated with final grades.
- Higher absences often lead to lower performance.
- Previous grades (G1, G2) are strong indicators of final grades.
- Visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts) help identify influential features.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
The following models were trained and evaluated:
- Linear Regression
