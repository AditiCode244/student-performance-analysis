# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using data science and machine learning techniques.
The objective is to understand factors affecting final grades and predict student outcomes.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python – programming language
- Jupyter Notebook – interactive coding and visualization
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

## 📊 Dataset Features
- The dataset contains information about students’ academic and personal details:
      studytime, failures, absences, G1, G2, G3 and more.
- Target variable: G3 (Final grade)
- Features include: study habits, family background, health, and prior performance.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Study time is positively correlated with final grades.
- Higher absences often lead to lower performance.
- Previous grades (G1, G2) are strong indicators of final grades.
- Visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts) help identify influential features.

## 🎯 Project Outcome
- Performed data cleaning and visualization
- Built a machine learning model to predict final grades
- Generated insights to help improve student performance

## 🎓 Academic Purpose
This project is created as part of a college Data Science & Machine Learning assignment.
